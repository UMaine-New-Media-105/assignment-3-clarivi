This is Assignment 3 for New Media 105: Creative Coding. 
Q1: This was the basis of our game in p5js. We started by creating a sprite for the catcher in our game. I chose to have my game be themed around the classic sci-fi trope
of UFOs capturing cows from the earth. As such, this meant that my catcher sprite would uniquely be at the top of the screen, so the cows can come up into it.
The sprite also follows the mouse position.

Q2: A simple addition on to the catcher sprite we made. This was to change our sprite so that when the mouse was clicked, it changed in some way. My idea was to have the 
staple green tractor beam show up under the UFO, and to have it's windows light up. In this version, I also added the feilds for the cows to stand on, the moon, and the 
first version of the cow sprite.

Q3: In this version, we were tasked with making the sprite fall, or in this case rise, from the ground. Using the cow sprite from earlier, it now rises from the ground
at a random position and goes up forever. I also added some cows to the field so that the cow doesnt look like it appears out of thin air. 

Q4: The game is starting to take form now, the cow now rises whenever the mouse is clicked and there isnt a cow already moving.
The cow gets deleted if it goes past the top of the screen.

Q5: The cow sprite is now destroyed when it comes in contact with the UFO, and creates a new cow on its own. I also added a mechanic where if the UFO is above the cow,
and the tractor beam is on (activated by holding left click) the cow will begin to rise faster, as if it is getting pulled by the beam. Additionally, the cow now rises
at a random speed. There is also a score dispayed at the top right that increases whenever a cow is captured, and text is printed to the console saying the same.
